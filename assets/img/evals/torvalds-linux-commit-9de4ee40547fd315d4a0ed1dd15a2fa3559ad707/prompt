   Uniform CD-ROM driver for Linux.
   See Documentation/cdrom/cdrom-standard.tex for usage information.

   The routines in the file provide a uniform interface between the
   software that uses CD-ROMs and the various low-level drivers that
   actually talk to the hardware. Suggestions are welcome.
   Patches that work are more welcome though.  ;-)

 To Do List:
 ----------------------------------

 -- Modify sysctl/proc interface. I plan on having one directory per
 drive, with entries for outputing general drive information, and sysctl
 based tunable parameters such as whether the tray should auto-close for
 that drive. Suggestions (or patches) for this welcome!


 Revision History
 ----------------------------------
 1.00  Date Unknown -- David van Leeuwen <david@tm.tno.nl>
 -- Initial version by David A. van Leeuwen. I don't have a detailed
  changelog for the 1.x series, David?

2.00  Dec  2, 1997 -- Erik Andersen <andersee@debian.org>
  -- New maintainer! As David A. van Leeuwen has been too busy to actively
  maintain and improve this driver, I am now carrying on the torch. If
  you have a problem with this driver, please feel free to contact me.

  -- Added (rudimentary) sysctl interface. I realize this is really weak
  right now, and is _very_ badly implemented. It will be improved...

  -- Modified CDROM_DISC_STATUS so that it is now incorporated into
  the Uniform CD-ROM driver via the cdrom_count_tracks function.
  The cdrom_count_tracks function helps resolve some of the false
  assumptions of the CDROM_DISC_STATUS ioctl, and is also used to check
  for the correct media type when mounting or playing audio from a CD.

  -- Remove the calls to verify_area and only use the copy_from_user and
  copy_to_user stuff, since these calls now provide their own memory
  checking with the 2.1.x kernels.

  -- Major update to return codes so that errors from low-level drivers
  are passed on through (thanks to Gerd Knorr for pointing out this
  problem).

  -- Made it so if a function isn't implemented in a low-level driver,
  ENOSYS is now returned instead of EINVAL.

  -- Simplified some complex logic so that the source code is easier to read.

  -- Other stuff I probably forgot to mention (lots of changes).

2.01 to 2.11 Dec 1997-Jan 1998
  -- TO-DO!  Write changelogs for 2.01 to 2.12.

2.12  Jan  24, 1998 -- Erik Andersen <andersee@debian.org>
  -- Fixed a bug in the IOCTL_IN and IOCTL_OUT macros.  It turns out that
  copy_*_user does not return EFAULT on error, but instead returns the number
  of bytes not copied.  I was returning whatever non-zero stuff came back from
  the copy_*_user functions directly, which would result in strange errors.

2.13  July 17, 1998 -- Erik Andersen <andersee@debian.org>
  -- Fixed a bug in CDROM_SELECT_SPEED where you couldn't lower the speed
  of the drive.  Thanks to Tobias Ringstr|m <tori@prosolvia.se> for pointing
  this out and providing a simple fix.
  -- Fixed the procfs-unload-module bug with the fill_inode procfs callback.
  thanks to Andrea Arcangeli
  -- Fixed it so that the /proc entry now also shows up when cdrom is
  compiled into the kernel.  Before it only worked when loaded as a module.

  2.14 August 17, 1998 -- Erik Andersen <andersee@debian.org>
  -- Fixed a bug in cdrom_media_changed and handling of reporting that
  the media had changed for devices that _don't_ implement media_changed.
  Thanks to Grant R. Guenther <grant@torque.net> for spotting this bug.
  -- Made a few things more pedanticly correct.

2.50 Oct 19, 1998 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- New maintainers! Erik was too busy to continue the work on the driver,
  so now Chris Zwilling <chris@cloudnet.com> and Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  will do their best to follow in his footsteps

  2.51 Dec 20, 1998 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- Check if drive is capable of doing what we ask before blindly changing
  cdi->options in various ioctl.
  -- Added version to proc entry.

  2.52 Jan 16, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- Fixed an error in open_for_data where we would sometimes not return
  the correct error value. Thanks Huba Gaspar <huba@softcell.hu>.
  -- Fixed module usage count - usage was based on /proc/sys/dev
  instead of /proc/sys/dev/cdrom. This could lead to an oops when other
  modules had entries in dev. Feb 02 - real bug was in sysctl.c where
  dev would be removed even though it was used. cdrom.c just illuminated
  that bug.

  2.53 Feb 22, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- Fixup of several ioctl calls, in particular CDROM_SET_OPTIONS has
  been "rewritten" because capabilities and options aren't in sync. They
  should be...
  -- Added CDROM_LOCKDOOR ioctl. Locks the door and keeps it that way.
  -- Added CDROM_RESET ioctl.
  -- Added CDROM_DEBUG ioctl. Enable debug messages on-the-fly.
  -- Added CDROM_GET_CAPABILITY ioctl. This relieves userspace programs
  from parsing /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info.

  2.54 Mar 15, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- Check capability mask from low level driver when counting tracks as
  per suggestion from Corey J. Scotts <cstotts@blue.weeg.uiowa.edu>.

  2.55 Apr 25, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- autoclose was mistakenly checked against CDC_OPEN_TRAY instead of
  CDC_CLOSE_TRAY.
  -- proc info didn't mask against capabilities mask.

  3.00 Aug 5, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- Unified audio ioctl handling across CD-ROM drivers. A lot of the
  code was duplicated before. Drives that support the generic packet
  interface are now being fed packets from here instead.
  -- First attempt at adding support for MMC2 commands - for DVD and
  CD-R(W) drives. Only the DVD parts are in now - the interface used is
  the same as for the audio ioctls.
  -- ioctl cleanups. if a drive couldn't play audio, it didn't get
  a change to perform device specific ioctls as well.
  -- Defined CDROM_CAN(CDC_XXX) for checking the capabilities.
  -- Put in sysctl files for autoclose, autoeject, check_media, debug,
  and lock.
  -- /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info has been updated to also contain info about
  CD-Rx and DVD capabilities.
  -- Now default to checking media type.
  -- CDROM_SEND_PACKET ioctl added. The infrastructure was in place for
  doing this anyway, with the generic_packet addition.

  3.01 Aug 6, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- Fix up the sysctl handling so that the option flags get set
  correctly.
  -- Fix up ioctl handling so the device specific ones actually get
  called :).

  3.02 Aug 8, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- Fixed volume control on SCSI drives (or others with longer audio
  page).
  -- Fixed a couple of DVD minors. Thanks to Andrew T. Veliath
  <andrewtv@usa.net> for telling me and for having defined the various
  DVD structures and ioctls in the first place! He designed the original
  DVD patches for ide-cd and while I rearranged and unified them, the
  interface is still the same.

  3.03 Sep 1, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- Moved the rest of the audio ioctls from the CD-ROM drivers here. Only
  CDROMREADTOCENTRY and CDROMREADTOCHDR are left.
  -- Moved the CDROMREADxxx ioctls in here.
  -- Defined the cdrom_get_last_written and cdrom_get_next_block as ioctls
  and exported functions.
  -- Erik Andersen <andersen@xmission.com> modified all SCMD_ commands
  to now read GPCMD_ for the new generic packet interface. All low level
  drivers are updated as well.
  -- Various other cleanups.

  3.04 Sep 12, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- Fixed a couple of possible memory leaks (if an operation failed and
  we didn't free the buffer before returning the error).
  -- Integrated Uniform CD Changer handling from Richard Sharman
  <rsharman@pobox.com>.
  -- Defined CD_DVD and CD_CHANGER log levels.
  -- Fixed the CDROMREADxxx ioctls.
  -- CDROMPLAYTRKIND uses the GPCMD_PLAY_AUDIO_MSF command - too few
  drives supported it. We lose the index part, however.
  -- Small modifications to accommodate opens of /dev/hdc1, required
  for ide-cd to handle multisession discs.
  -- Export cdrom_mode_sense and cdrom_mode_select.
  -- init_cdrom_command() for setting up a cgc command.

  3.05 Oct 24, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- Changed the interface for CDROM_SEND_PACKET. Before it was virtually
  impossible to send the drive data in a sensible way.
  -- Lowered stack usage in mmc_ioctl(), dvd_read_disckey(), and
  dvd_read_manufact.
  -- Added setup of write mode for packet writing.
  -- Fixed CDDA ripping with cdda2wav - accept much larger requests of
  number of frames and split the reads in blocks of 8.

  3.06 Dec 13, 1999 - Jens Axboe <axboe@image.dk>
  -- Added support for changing the region of DVD drives.
  -- Added sense data to generic command.

  3.07 Feb 2, 2000 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
  -- Do same "read header length" trick in cdrom_get_disc_info() as
  we do in cdrom_get_track_info() -- some drive don't obey specs and
  fail if they can't supply the full Mt Fuji size table.
  -- Deleted stuff related to setting up write modes. It has a different
  home now.
  -- Clear header length in mode_select unconditionally.
  -- Removed the register_disk() that was added, not needed here.

  3.08 May 1, 2000 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
  -- Fix direction flag in setup_send_key and setup_report_key. This
  gave some SCSI adapters problems.
  -- Always return -EROFS for write opens
  -- Convert to module_init/module_exit style init and remove some
  of the #ifdef MODULE stuff
  -- Fix several dvd errors - DVD_LU_SEND_ASF should pass agid,
  DVD_HOST_SEND_RPC_STATE did not set buffer size in cdb, and
  dvd_do_auth passed uninitialized data to drive because init_cdrom_command
  did not clear a 0 sized buffer.

  3.09 May 12, 2000 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
  -- Fix Video-CD on SCSI drives that don't support READ_CD command. In
  that case switch block size and issue plain READ_10 again, then switch
  back.

  3.10 Jun 10, 2000 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
  -- Fix volume control on CD's - old SCSI-II drives now use their own
  code, as doing MODE6 stuff in here is really not my intention.
  -- Use READ_DISC_INFO for more reliable end-of-disc.

  3.11 Jun 12, 2000 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
  -- Fix bug in getting rpc phase 2 region info.
  -- Reinstate "correct" CDROMPLAYTRKIND

   3.12 Oct 18, 2000 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
  -- Use quiet bit on packet commands not known to work

   3.20 Dec 17, 2003 - Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>
  -- Various fixes and lots of cleanups not listed :-)
  -- Locking fixes
  -- Mt Rainier support
  -- DVD-RAM write open fixes

  Nov 5 2001, Aug 8 2002. Modified by Andy Polyakov
  <appro@fy.chalmers.se> to support MMC-3 compliant DVD+RW units.

  Modified by Nigel Kukard <nkukard@lbsd.net> - support DVD+RW
  2.4.x patch by Andy Polyakov <appro@fy.chalmers.se>
